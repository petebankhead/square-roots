# Square root transform for variance stabilization

Jupyter notebook to demonstrate how the square root transform can be useful to stabilize the noise in fluorescence microscopy.

If you want to find the source of the transform, you could try [Anscombe (1948)](https://doi.org/10.1093/biomet/35.3-4.246) who cites [Bartlett (1936)](https://doi.org/10.2307/2983678).

Some of the underlying concepts are explained in more detail at https://petebankhead.gitbooks.io/imagej-intro
